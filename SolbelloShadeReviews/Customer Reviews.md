    <div class="comment">First 2 weeks at the beach. Love it! Shade works great! What a simple lightweight design! Only had 1 day where we had to use cords for low wind. Shade is super lightweight to carry. Two suggestions to consider… 1. Offer a slightly larger size, though the 8x8 offers a decent footprint, afternoon sun angles create a smaller footprint that is not big enough for 2 folks. 2. Offer a secondary or adjustable shoulder strap, the stationary single carry strap is too big for small folks and is entirely useless for larger folks. Current strap on carry bag made it awkward for the hike to the beach. Consider adding a handle carry strap.</div>

    <div class="comment">My Solbello review. I was very pleased with my Solbello! It was easy and fast to put up. I was able to get 2 chairs under easy, and 3 if you wanted to sit a little closer. I also like the shade option on days when it is not windy! I would recommend to any of my friends.</div>

    <div class="comment">Without doubt the best option for beach shade. I tried and have them all - umbrellas, canopy tents, curved shade devices - and this one wins hands down. [...] Definitely a winner - liked it so much I bought two.</div>

    <div class="comment">Simple Shade. I saw Solbello on the beach and watched as the young ladies set it up. Portability, ease of use, quick set-up and tons of shade. No more wandering beach umbrellas for this family. We especially enjoy the wind direction</div>

    <p>“This has to be one of the best purchases that I have ever made!!! It is so simple and quick for one person to put up and take down and it provides excellent shade. I also have the 'Bumi' but the Solbello is my preferred sunshade. It takes very little breeze for this shade to work and I love how the shade pivots when the direction of the wind changes. Go ahead and purchase it—you will enjoy your time on the sun/shade!!!”</p>

    <p>“So easy to set up and perfect for me and my dog. On your shoulder very much like an umbrella but much lighter. Took me about 5 minutes to set up only because I didn’t look at it until I got to the beach. Had a few people ask me about the product. I had no worries that it would blow away. Love it.”</p>

I had a new pole shipped quickly and also received 2 drink koozies, a trucker hat, and business cards as well! It was fast shipping! Definitely worth the money!!”</p>

    <p>“I have tried this out on both low wind days and average wind days at the beach and found that on low wind days, it rotated too much if it was an offshore breeze, otherwise it performed very well. I like it because I can go to the beach on my own and still have shade with minimal effort.”</p>

    <p>“Loved the shade. I used it while on my cruise. The only problem was the wind. The seats were all next to each other, so I couldn't let it fly with the wind, but I used the stakes and we got it to work sufficiently well to shade our seats. I was shaded and was able to feel unobstructed breeze and have unobstructed views (cannot say that for people sitting behind us).”</p>
